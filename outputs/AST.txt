The output contains a tree structure, in which each row represent a node in the tree. For each node, the name of the statement, the memory location, the location of the statement in the source code, the type of the data represented.

The most interesting thing I find about the AST dump is that the source code of examples/gcd.c is organized as one root node that has three children. Inside the source code, the body of the function is simplified as three main parts (children nodes): two parameter declaration statements and a compound statement (if-else statement). Such simplification makes implementation to traverse and work with the AST tree easier.
